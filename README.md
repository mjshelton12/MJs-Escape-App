<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Escape App is a text style game that is played within a browser page. The user navigates around a home using button prompts to find what item(s) they need to escape.

This repository is a continued development by MJ Shelton. She chose to continue the project in order to further work on the app's functionality, user experience, and gameplay. None of the work seen here would have been posible without the hours of hard work put in by the original group memebers.
